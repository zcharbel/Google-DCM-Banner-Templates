# Google DCM banner templates
This is a base template for building a banner within Google DCM that allows you to build your banners then minify HTML, JS and CSS and optimize images for uploading to Google Double Click.

### How do I get set up? ###

To get up and running, follow the steps below.

- navigate to your project's root directory within terminal
- run "npm install" to install dependicies
- run "grunt"

Once "grunt" is run, all banners are output into the "production" folder located within your root project folder, ready for release.
